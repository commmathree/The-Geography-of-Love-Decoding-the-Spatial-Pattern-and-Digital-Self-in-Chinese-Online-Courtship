Code Files for Thesis Project

The evolution of Chinese online courtship culture is a mixed product under dynamic interaction between the feudal tradition, urban development and government policies. The presented research examines the regional online dating popularity, spatial homogamy and the self-presentation pattern in the cyber love market, with a special focus on the geographical factors. More than 30 thousand recent data are collected from Chinaâ€™s biggest online dating site jiayuan.com, and analyzed through the techniques of ordered logit modeling, Katz centrality analysis and word2Vec natural language processing (NLP). The results indicate that the high user density spots are widely spread among different parts of China rather than only clustering in the developed areas. While major users expect a within-city distance with the potential dater, the increasing social mobility and cross-city mating trend is also driven by the motivation of gaining localized access to better social and welfare resources. Moreover, people tend to emphasize the soft qualities of caring, reliable and family engagement in the online self-presentation, with the marriage pragmatism overweighing the personalized individualism and emotional self.
